# Rails_SAST_Evaluation_Project 

This repo is a very simple application build with Rails framework and the intention is to evaluate the performance of some SAST tools 

## Getting Started

To begin, you just need get ruby (2.7.4), Rails (6.1.6) bundle and gem installed

After installing the above software, clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:dingjiedanielyang-sec/Rails_SAST_Evaluation_Project.git
```


Navigate into the directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

After installing all the dependencies, you should be able to run the application with the following command

```bash
$ rails server -p 3001
```

Access the application with http://localhost:3001 




**Note**

You don't have to run the application if you just want to perform a SAST scan.
